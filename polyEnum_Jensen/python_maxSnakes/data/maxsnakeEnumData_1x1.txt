Jensen-style algorithm to find maximal snake in an 1 x 1 square (using conjecture 2/3 + min_bound pruning)
Max area: 1 
Number of configurations: 1
Here are some column by column stats:
	Number of pruned signatures with construction and 2/3 theorem: {}
	Number of pruned signatures with vert_symmetries: {0: 1}
	Number of total sigs per column before vert_symmetry pruning: {1: 2}
Program runtime: 0.00s
