Jensen-style algorithm to find maximal snake in an 3 x 3 square (using conjecture 2/3 + min_bound pruning)
Max area: 7 
Number of configurations: 8
Here are some column by column stats:
	Number of pruned signatures with construction and 2/3 theorem: {1: 4, 2: 2}
	Number of pruned signatures with vert_symmetries: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}
	Number of total sigs per column before vert_symmetry pruning: {1: 4, 2: 7, 3: 13}
Program runtime: 0.00s
