Jensen-style algorithm to find maximal snake in an 4 x 4 square (using conjecture 2/3 + min_bound pruning)
Max area: 11 
Number of configurations: 84
Here are some column by column stats:
	Number of pruned signatures with construction and 2/3 theorem: {1: 1, 2: 29, 3: 6}
	Number of pruned signatures with vert_symmetries: {0: 1, 1: 6, 2: 3, 3: 10}
	Number of total sigs per column before vert_symmetry pruning: {1: 15, 2: 21, 3: 50, 4: 80}
Program runtime: 0.01s
